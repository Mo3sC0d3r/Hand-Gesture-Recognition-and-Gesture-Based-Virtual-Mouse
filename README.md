# Hand-Gesture-Recognition-and-Gesture-Based-Virtual-Mouse
Hand Gesture Recognition and Gesture Based Virtual Mouse Using Neural Networks

Use the Capture.py file to create a dataset of images to use for training 
Or extract the mydata.zip Zip file that contains already taken image 

Use the cnn_model.py file that contains the model to train which creates and saves a pretrained model that will be used in other files 

Use the test_model.py file to test the model. It choses 10 random images from the training set passes them through the model for recognition and indicates the actual gesture and the predicted gesture

Use the Recognise.py file to make the recognition in real time via the webcam ( Make sure to adjust the trackbars to over come the lighting condition around the environment your in and for proper background subtraction)

Use the GestureVMouse. py file to control the mouse point and some other mouse operation using defined hand gestures
